# Ibuprofen Delivery Reinforcement Learning

This project simulates the delivery of ibuprofen through a reinforcement learning (RL) agent. The agent interacts with a custom environment that models the pharmacokinetics of ibuprofen in the human body. The goal of the agent is to maintain plasma concentration within a therapeutic range while avoiding toxicity. The project uses **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** for training the agent.
